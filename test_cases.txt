# Heart Disease Predictor Test Cases

## Typical Cases

1. Middle-aged adult with average health metrics:
   - Number of major vessels colored (ca): 1
   - ST depression (oldpeak): 1.0
   - Age: 55
   - Cholesterol (chol): 220
   - Max heart rate (thalch): 140
   - Thalassemia (thal): 3 (Normal)
   - Resting blood pressure (trestbps): 130

2. Younger adult with good health metrics:
   - ca: 0
   - oldpeak: 0.5
   - Age: 35
   - chol: 180
   - thalch: 170
   - thal: 3 (Normal)
   - trestbps: 120

3. Older adult with some concerning metrics:
   - ca: 2
   - oldpeak: 2.5
   - Age: 68
   - chol: 280
   - thalch: 120
   - thal: 6 (Fixed defect)
   - trestbps: 150

## Edge Cases
